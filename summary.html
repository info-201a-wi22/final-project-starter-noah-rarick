    <h2>Project Takeaways</h2>
    <p>Our intention in the beginning of the project was to find relationships between sleep quality and other factors such as a anxiety, depression, and daily habits such as exercise.
    However, what we found did not necessarily line up with our expectations. In the first data visualization, participants who had a reported sleep quality of ~5 had the highest anxiety scores.
    Participants with high sleep quality had similar anxiety levels to those with lower sleep quality. This throws off our original assumption that lower sleep quality is a driving factor
    in anxiety/depression. However, one pattern you can see from the first data visualization is that the young demographic had much higher anxiety scores at almost all sleep quality scores.
    
    With the second data visualization we were hoping to prove that exercise helped with deep sleep and sleep quality overall. However what we found is that when calorie expenditure increased,
    sleep minutes varied increasingly. Therefore, we cannot draw a relationship between minutes slept and calories burnt. Additionally, this data set was created from fitbit data for one individual, compared
    to the first data viz which used a large number of participants. So while burning more calories did not improve the sleep of this individual, it may for other individuals which could lead to a future research project
    to branch off from this one.</p>
