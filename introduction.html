    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>_Sleep_Project_ is aiming to calculate trends between sleep quality and depression/anxiety.
        Sleep is incredibly important for an individualâ€™s wellbeing, however, is often overlooked as a driving factor in depression, anxiety and panic levels.
        This project will focus on data reported on individuals regarding depression, anxiety, panic, BMI and age and see how these factors are related to sleep quality.
        By analyzing these trends, hopefully it will become apparent what correlating factors either promote or reduce sleep quality. Our data sets come from two separate sources,
        one being from a Swedish study with hundreds of participants from all ages and backgrounds, this study collected hundreds of unique observations to summarize each participant.
        Our other data set comes from a single individual's fitbit data, we included this data as we wanted to have a more controlled data set when compared to our larger
        Swedish data set. As the data is only coming from one individual we can more closely examine the relationship between sleep and anxiety.
