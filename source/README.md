# The `/source` Directory

All of our project code is found in this directory.  We further organize our code into 
these sub-directories (TODO: Update/Delete)

|Source Directories | Brief Description|
|---------------| -----------------|

|[Chart_1]("./Chart_1/Data_Visualization_1.R") | The implementation of the grouped dodged column bar chart data visualization is a means of illustrating the correlation between an individualâ€™s sleep quality and reported level of depression. By grouping the data based on age group (Young versus Old versus NA), the data visualization showcases the deviation among the specified features. From the chart, we can see that as sleep quality diminishes (increases in value), young individuals are more prone to experiencing higher levels of depression, while depression levels remain fairly consistent across different sleep quality values for old individuals.
 

|[scatter plot about relation between sleep quality and anxiety depends on age](./chart_3/chart_final.R) | This graph is about the show the relationship between people's sleeping quality and they anxiety they have. The graph is a scatter plot and will show how each point which representing a different age group are displayed.The age group are young, old and NA.So people can see how the old and young people's sleep quality data will be affected by their anxiety point. The graph has reveal that young people are more likely to be affected by anxiety level since they will have a larger range and spread out in the graph. The young people is are more likely to appear at the high level of anxiety and high sleep quality index while the old people is more likely to appear at low level for both level.

# DEVELOPER NOTE 1: About ... 
* All source code for your projects should go in the `/source` directory
* To organize your code, you might decide to create sub-directories, which is fine.
* If you use sub-directories, plese briefly describe them

# DEVELOPER NOTE 2:  Clear and Concise Documentation
* Please remember your audience (prospective employers, open source colleagues, TAs, Instructors). Therefore, 
aim for clarity and conciseness.
* When done, be sure to delete these NOTE sections and the example CSV file (which are intended for you, of course, not your audience!)
