# The `/source` Directory

All of our project code is found in this directory.  We further organize our code into 
these sub-directories (TODO: Update/Delete)

|Source Directories | Brief Description|
|---------------| -----------------|
|[Chart_1]("./source/Chart_1") | The implementation of the grouped dodged column bar chart data visualization is a means of illustrating the correlation between an individualâ€™s sleep quality and reported level of depression. By grouping the data based on age group (Young versus Old versus NA), the data visualization showcases the deviation among the specified features. From the chart, we can see that as sleep quality diminishes (increases in value), young individuals are more prone to experiencing higher levels of depression, while depression levels remain fairly consistent across different sleep quality values for old individuals.

# DEVELOPER NOTE 1: About ... 
* All source code for your projects should go in the `/source` directory
* To organize your code, you might decide to create sub-directories, which is fine.
* If you use sub-directories, plese briefly describe them

# DEVELOPER NOTE 2:  Clear and Concise Documentation
* Please remember your audience (prospective employers, open source colleagues, TAs, Instructors). Therefore, 
aim for clarity and conciseness.
* When done, be sure to delete these NOTE sections and the example CSV file (which are intended for you, of course, not your audience!)
