# The `/source` Directory

All of our project code is found in this directory.  We further organize our code into 
these sub-directories (TODO: Update/Delete)

|Source Directories | Brief Description|
|---------------| -----------------|
|[xxx](./chart_3) | This graph is about the show the relationship between people's sleeping quality and they anxiety they have. Also, people are grouped by different age. So that people can see how the old and young people's sleep quality data will be affected by their anxiety point. The graph has reveal that young people are more likely to be affected by anxiety level since they will have a larger range of anxiety level when sleep quality differ.

# DEVELOPER NOTE 1: About ... 
* All source code for your projects should go in the `/source` directory
* To organize your code, you might decide to create sub-directories, which is fine.
* If you use sub-directories, plese briefly describe them

# DEVELOPER NOTE 2:  Clear and Concise Documentation
* Please remember your audience (prospective employers, open source colleagues, TAs, Instructors). Therefore, 
aim for clarity and conciseness.
* When done, be sure to delete these NOTE sections and the example CSV file (which are intended for you, of course, not your audience!)
