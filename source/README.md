# The `/source` Directory

All of our project code is found in this directory.  We further organize our code into 
these sub-directories (TODO: Update/Delete)

|Source Directories | Brief Description|
|---------------| -----------------|

|[Chart_1]("./source/Chart_1") | The implementation of the grouped dodged column bar chart data visualization is a means of illustrating the correlation between an individualâ€™s sleep quality and reported level of depression. By grouping the data based on age group (Young versus Old versus NA), the data visualization showcases the deviation among the specified features. From the chart, we can see that as sleep quality diminishes (increases in value), young individuals are more prone to experiencing higher levels of depression, while depression levels remain fairly consistent across different sleep quality values for old individuals. 
 

|[boxplot about relation between sleep quality and anxiety depends on age](./chart_3/chart_final.R) | This graph is about the show the relationship between people's sleeping quality and they anxiety they have. Also, people are grouped by different age. So that people can see how the old and young people's sleep quality data will be affected by their anxiety point. The graph has reveal that young people are more likely to be affected by anxiety level since they will have a larger range of anxiety level when sleep quality differ.

# DEVELOPER NOTE 1: About ... 
* All source code for your projects should go in the `/source` directory
* To organize your code, you might decide to create sub-directories, which is fine.
* If you use sub-directories, plese briefly describe them

# DEVELOPER NOTE 2:  Clear and Concise Documentation
* Please remember your audience (prospective employers, open source colleagues, TAs, Instructors). Therefore, 
aim for clarity and conciseness.
* When done, be sure to delete these NOTE sections and the example CSV file (which are intended for you, of course, not your audience!)
